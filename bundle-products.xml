		<description>BioTrue ONEday are daily wear contact lenses released by Bausch &amp; Lomb. Buy one box of 90 lenses. BioTrue One Day lenses have been developed with HyperGel, a material designed to mimic the lipid layer of the tear film. The outer surface of the lens has a similar water content to the cornea and is designed to mimic the tear film lipid layer. This reduces dehydration of the eye and maintains excellent and clear optical quality. The BioTrue daily contact lenses have high oxygen permeability without the need for silicone which means that the lenses are inherently more hydrating and comfortable. High breathability is essential to maintain good ocular health with clear, healthy eyes. BioTrue lenses incorporate a UV filter to absorb the majority of UVA and UVB radiation.</description>
